#### Scenario:

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

#### Ask
##### Guiding Questions
* What is the problem you are trying to solve?

    The goal is to identify differences in how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic's bikes in the hopes to get casual rider to become members.
    
* How can your insights drive business decisions?
    
    These insights can be use to increase the number of annual memberships furthering the company's success.
   
#### Prepare

On the over hand, this data can provide key insights where and for how long the riders use the bikes 
which can lead to key differences in annual member vs casual riders. 

The data contains the following information:
